## Enhanced Admin Order Management System

### Phase 1: Core Order Verification Features âš¡ NEXT PRIORITY

#### Real-time Notifications
- [ ] Implement native WebSocket connection for admin panel
- [ ] Add WebSocket notification service to backend  
- [ ] Create notification sound system ("casino win" style)
- [ ] Add order notification UI components in admin panel
- [ ] Test multi-channel notifications (WebSocket + Telegram backup)

#### Order Verification Interface
- [ ] Create order verification screen in admin panel
- [ ] Design side-by-side comparison table (Expected vs Actual):
  - Product name display
  - Expected weight/quantity â†’ Actual weight/quantity input fields  
  - Expected price â†’ Calculated actual price (real-time updates)
- [ ] Implement real-time price recalculation engine
- [ ] Add Confirm/Cancel buttons for order processing
- [ ] Create pick list generation for managers

#### Auto-confirmation System
- [ ] Add admin configurable threshold setting (default: 10% price variance)
- [ ] Implement threshold check AFTER manager enters actual weights
- [ ] Auto-proceed if difference < threshold (no additional confirmation needed)
- [ ] Require manual confirmation only if difference > threshold  
- [ ] Add verified orders to delivery queue automatically

#### Order Status Management
- [ ] Update order status workflow: pending â†’ verified â†’ confirmed â†’ delivering â†’ delivered
- [ ] Create "waiting for delivery" order list
- [ ] Add manual order cancellation functionality for managers
- [ ] Implement delivery queue management

**Priority**: High âš¡  
**Status**: Ready to start - foundation complete  
**Notes**: Core enhancement for small seafood businesses. Manager workflow efficiency focus.

**âœ… Prerequisites Complete**:
- Test framework (100% success rate)
- JWT authentication system  
- Database schema foundation
- Git repository structure

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Future)

#### Customer Re-confirmation Flow
- [ ] Customer notification for significant order changes
- [ ] Customer approval/decline interface
- [ ] Integrate customer re-confirmation with order flow

#### Enhanced Configuration
- [ ] Per-category price variance thresholds
- [ ] Configurable notification sounds
- [ ] Delivery address requirement toggle
- [ ] Manager permission levels

#### Feedback System
- [ ] Automated post-delivery feedback collection
- [ ] 1-5 star rating system
- [ ] Detailed feedback for ratings <5 stars
- [ ] Configurable feedback timing (admin setting)

#### Integrations
- [ ] Auto-payment processing integration
- [ ] Invoice generation system
- [ ] Accounting software integration
- [ ] Inventory management integration

**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Future Planning  
**Notes**: Features for scaling to larger businesses and enhanced customer experience.

- [ ] Create WebSocket connection management in React admin panel
- [ ] Implement connection recovery and reconnection logic
- [ ] Add WebSocket authentication and security

### Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Add order verification fields (actual_weights, actual_quantities)
- [ ] Create admin settings table for thresholds and configurations
- [ ] Add delivery queue status tracking
- [ ] Update order status enum with new verification states

### API Enhancements
- [ ] Create order verification endpoints
- [ ] Add real-time price calculation API
- [ ] Implement admin settings management endpoints
- [ ] Add delivery queue management endpoints

**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Required for Phase 1  
**Notes**: Technical foundation for enhanced admin features.
